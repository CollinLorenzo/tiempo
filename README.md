## Install

First you need to install the project root dependencies to start using it.

To install dependencies you will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), so go get it if you don't have it yet, then run:

```sh
yarn
```

After that, you need to bootstrap all packages. This will install all packages dependencies and link them together.

```sh
yarn bootstrap
```

## Running

You can start all packages.

If you want to run each package individually, get a read in each package README to know how to run it.
